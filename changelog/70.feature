Enhanced accessibility compliance with semantic headings, improved contrast, and visible focus states for WCAG AA standards.

Implemented comprehensive accessibility improvements including proper heading hierarchy (H1→H2→H3) across all pages, enhanced focus states for keyboard navigation with 3px outlines and sufficient color contrast, skip links for screen readers, and improved ARIA labels throughout navigation and footer elements. Fixed duplicate H1 issues on homepage and project pages using conditional layout logic and body classes. Enhanced color contrast ratios for text, links, and UI elements to meet WCAG AA guidelines. Added semantic roles (main, navigation, contentinfo) and improved link descriptions with context-aware ARIA labels. Implemented visible focus indicators for all interactive elements including forms, buttons, cards, and navigation items. Created responsive accessibility features maintaining usability across all device sizes and interaction methods.
