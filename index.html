<p>I have a lot of hats and titles. Some of them are network engineer, software developer, ultra runner, trail runner, scuba diver, and explorer. I have a strong sense of wanderlust. I'm also passionate about technology. Writing software and automating networks not only pays the bills, but it is also an outlet for expressing my creativity. When I'm not doing that, I have many hobbies and interests that allow me to travel, explore, partake in scientific expeditions, and document my experiences with images and video. This site is a combination of two domains:</p>
