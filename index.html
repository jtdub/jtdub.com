            With over 20 years of experience in the tech industry, I've navigated the roles of
            Linux systems administrator, network engineer, and network automation engineer.
            Along the way, I've mastered programming languages like Python, Ruby, Bash, and Perl,
            while leveraging automation frameworks such as Ansible and Salt to solve complex
            challenges. My career spans industries, including financial services, higher education,
            and hosting providers, where I've tackled everything from system optimization to
            network scalability.

        <p>But my curiosity doesn't stop at technology.</p>

        <p>
            Since 2004, I've been a scuba diver and an underwater cave explorer, venturing into
            some of the most awe-inspiring and remote aquatic environments. These experiences
            have deepened my love for discovery and adventure.

        <p>
            I'm also a dedicated anthropology student with a focus on the Andean cultures of
            southeastern Peru and the indigenous cultures of the American Southwest. My passion
            lies in exploring how people interact with their environment, their histories, and
            their ritualsâ€”an intersection of science, humanity, and culture that constantly
            fuels my curiosity.
