<p>I have a lot of hats and titles. Some of them are network engineer, software developer, ultra runner, trail runner, scuba diver, and explorer. 
    I have a strong sense of wanderlust. I'm also passionate about technology. Writing software and automating networks not only pays the bills,
    but it is also an outlet for expressing my creativity. When I'm not doing that, I have many hobbies and interests that allow me to travel,
    explore, partake in scientific expeditions, and document my experiences with images and video. This site is a combination of two domains:
    <ul class="list-group list-group-flush">
        <li class="list-group-item"><a href="https://www.packetgeek.net">https://www.packetgeek.net</a>, which was my technology blog for many years. 
            It's a place where I put my study notes, technology observations, and technology related thoughts.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item"><a href="https://www.jtdub.com">https://www.jtdub.com</a>, which was a personal site, where I shared images,
            videos, essays, tales of wanderlust, and just anything that was on my mind at the moment.</li>
    </ul>
