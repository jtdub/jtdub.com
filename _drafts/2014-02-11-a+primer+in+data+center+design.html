When most people think about data centers, they think about racks of servers in an air conditioned room. Very few people consider how those racks should be laid out, how much power is needed to power all the servers, switches, routers, etc, or how much cooling is needed to keep the room at a acceptable temperature to keep all that equipment in proper working order. This article will delve briefly into the concept of cool / hot isles, power requirements, and cooling requirements. <br/><br/>I've worked in a few data centers over the years. Part of the job role that I assumed was determining data center design. Many IT folks, particularly in small data centers, think that it's just a room with a bunch of computers. In actuality, there is a lot of design considerations and two of the more important design considerations don't even involve technology. Those design considerations are power and cooling. This blog will go through some of those considerations when designing a data center.<br/><br/>When designing a data center, the biggest factor that goes into how many servers that you can cram into a room or even just a rack is how much power that you have to work with. Every server and networking vendor worth their salt will provide power stats for their equipment. The things that you want to look for are Watts, Amperes, and power plug (receptacle) types.<br/><br/>&nbsp;<br/><br/>&nbsp;<br/><br/>&nbsp;<br/><br/>http://en.community.dell.com/support-forums/servers/f/946/t/18034583.aspx<br/><br/>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampere<br/><br/>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt<br/><br/>http://users.cis.fiu.edu/~tho01/psg/plug/plug.html
