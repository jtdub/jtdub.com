In 2014, I embarked on a expedition to Peru with some friends and acquaintances. The purpose of the expedition was multifaceted. There was a small team of scientists, GIS folks, film makers, and my friends and I were there as scuba divers.<br/><br/>The dive team had a couple of objectives. Our primary objective was to explore the lake and document known archeological areas of interest as well as attempt a deep technical dive - searching the lake for other archeological artifacts in the deeper parts of the lake.<br/><br/>What makes the diving difficult at this lake is that its altitude is at 16,000 ft / 4900 m above sea-level and it's very remote. Beyond our team, there have only been a couple of other scuba dives, anywhere in the world, at this altitude. Also, the logistics of getting dive gear to the location are very difficult. Our team attempted to ship a crate of dive gear; consisting of rebreathers, tanks, sofnolime, and other odds and ends. Unfortunately, getting our gear through customs in a timely manner proved to be futile. This led us the team to regroup. We took an inventory of all the dive gear that we were able to get our hands on and came up with a new game plan that was supposed to allow us to keep our two dive objectives.<br/><br/>As we were already running behind schedule, a few of us stayed in Lima to continue with the logistics of getting tanks filled and other logistics wrapped up, while the rest of the expedition team continued to Cusco to keep their altitude acclimatization schedule. We rented a truck, in Lima, to transport the filled scuba tanks and other gear and we set off on a drive from Lima to Cusco. The drive was supposed to be ~16 hours and we made a plan to drive straight through, switching driving roles every four hours. Humberto took the first driving shift and we left Lima at around 23:30. Along the way, George starting getting feeling an upset stomach. When we pulled over to switch drivers, we took a small break. At that time, it became obvious that George most likely had food poisoning. At that point, I started driving - from approximately Nazca.<br/><br/>Driving up the steep mountains of the Peruvian Andes was a bit of nerve racking, at first. This is due to the numerous blind switch backs and passenger buses flying down the mountains. There were a number of switch backs that you'd find a bus coming around the corner in your lane of traffic. Swerving out of its way was a no-go, as you either had the side of a mountain to stop you, or you had a cliff that you'd drive off of. You just had to trust that the bus would get back into its lane of traffic before you collided head on. Once at the top of the mountains, there is a large, flat plateau that often reminded me of the high-plains of the Texas panhandle. There were several stretches of road where you'd drive down through a mountain river valley with a giant wall of conglomerate on one side and limestone on the other. Then, you'd make your way back up to the plateau. It was an absolutely stunning drive. I'd love to make that drive again, taking my time to be able to take in the sights and explore. At one point, traffic came to a complete halt along the river valley because the river washed out the road and a road crew was hurriedly working to restore the road by moving boulders from the river to the hole in the road and filling the road in with dirt. This process took a few hours and was one of the most efficient road construction projects that I've ever witnessed. We rolled into Cusco at ~ 21:00 the next evening.<br/><br/>In Cusco, we spent time recuperating from the long drive, acclimatizing to the altitude, and watched as the rest of the team started their trek to the field. We would be once again trailing them by a day.<br/><br/>After a couple days of acclimatizing, a truck and driver showed up to our hotel. We loaded the tanks and our gear into the truck and we started the journey to get as close to the northern end of Laguña Sibinacocha before the road ended. The drive itself took about six hours, however, it's a stunningly beautiful drive through some of the more remote areas of the Peruvian Andes. Much of the drive is on a rugged dirt road. Eventually, we enter a small village of Selma. Selma consists of a horse coral and a couple small, scattered buildings. This is were the road ended. Nobody was there. The driver quickly unloaded our gear and tanks and without even saying "<em>adiós</em>", he got into his truck and drove off. For the next hour or so, we just laid on the ground and took a nap. I wasn't sure exactly what I expected, but this wasn't it. I secretly started going through contingencies of setting up camp where we were.<br/><br/>Soon enough, a team of horses and some Arrieros showed up. Arrieros, muleteer in Quechua, are the local guides. They often live at or near the lake and know the land and the neighbors at the lake better than anybody else. After quick introductions, they started loading up the horses and George, Humberto, and myself started the walk to the lake. I expected a long afternoon of walking. I was told to expect a four hour walk, or approximately four miles. The walk only took half that time. It was mostly pretty easy walking, or  rather, as easy as walking over rolling hills at an elevation of 16,000 ft (~4900 m) can be.<br/><br/>When we got to camp, the sun was starting to set over the western ridge and it got cold fast. We rushed to set up our tents and get our gear squared away before settling into the community tent for dinner. That first night, I was pretty tired, even though I didn't feel as though I was very productive that day. As such, I went to bed pretty early. That first night was pretty rough. My body was struggling to acclimate to the altitude and it felt like my heart was trying to pound through my chest. I got very little sleep that first night.<br/><br/>The next few days were spent acclimatizing, organizing dive gear, watching scientists work, and performing shallow dives - familiarizing ourselves with the known archeological artifacts of interests. On August, 20, George and Geoff prepared for their deep dive. It was a pretty somber morning and I was anxious watching them set off on their dive. I sat in a little gully, in my drysuit, at the waters edge watching Humberto in a kayak on the lake. He was following the bubbles of the divers. After a while he was so far out that he became just a small blip on the lake and I couldn't make out any detail as to what he was doing. Watching my watch, I felt as though George and Geoff should be surfacing any minute. I could see Humberto paddling. Preston came over the hill and verified with me that the green SMB meant that something was wrong and to send help. He then said that a green SMB was up. From my vantage point, I couldn't see the SMB, so I quickly walked up onto the top of a nearby hill.<br/><br/>My heart sunk. I put on Sacha's BCD, grabbed my fins and mask and started making a surface swim towards the SMB. After what seemed like forever, I made my way to Humberto, whom was hurriedly attempting to paddle into shore. George was on the surface, face down in the water, with a hand tied to the kayak, in tow. I thought George was dead. I asked where Geoff was. In a panicky tone, Humberto pointed to the SMB, which was now laid over, and told me over there. I was still about 20 yards away. I swam that way as quickly as I could. When I got to the SMB, I pulled gently on the line, hoping more than anything that there would be resistance of a diver holding on to the other end. When that wasn't the case, I slowly pulled the line up until I could see a lonely spool with no diver attached. I dropped the spool back into the water, watching it drift down to the depths. Realizing that I hadn't seen any bubbles surfacing in the area, I lost it and started yelling.<br/><br/>Shortly after that, Preston arrived in a kayak and asked me if Geoff was on the line. I told him no. By this time, I'd been bobbing on the surface of the ~44 degree water for about 40 minutes and was getting quite cold - my feet and hands were completely numb. I started making a long swim back to the shore, laying on my back, completely in shock.<br/><br/>A while later, Wetherbee pulled up next to me and towed me into shore. I was stripped from my drysuit and had warm, dry cloths put on me, and wrapped in a blanket. I laid on the ground for a short period of time, where I watched George, bundled in a sleeping bag, and completely shivering. Then, as if he had just relived todays events in his head, he rolled onto his side and started to sob quietly.<br/><br/>While I laid there, the search continued for Geoff. People were out on kayaks, on top of hills scanning the lake with binoculars, making evacuation plans via satellite phone, and trekking to the other side of the lake to look for signs of Geoff. We found nothing and knew the worst had happened, even if we completely denied it in the depths of our mind. The search continued for several hours, until sunset, when we knew that we needed to start making plans to evacuate George.<br/><br/>George had a very serious case of type 2 DCS, which ultimately left him paralyzed for several months from the chest down. As remote as Sibinacocha is, we knew that an evacuation for George wouldn't be easy. We arranged for an guide service to meet us at the end of the road in Selma. Starting at around 20:00, Dr. Halvorson, Sacha, George, and a couple <em>Arrieros</em> started the trek to Selma, which George riding a horse and the rest of us walking. Within minutes of starting the trek, George; unable to hold himself up due to his injury slouched over and began to fall off the horse. We laid George on the ground and we gathered around him to maintain body heat while Dr. Halvorson went back to came to gather more help and gather supplied for Plan B. Plan B would involve creating a stretcher out of two wooden poles, an inflatable kayak, and rope. Sacha would ride the horse, I would lead the horse, and the remainder of the expedition members would attempt to carry George the remainder of the way out of the field. We're not used to this level of exertion, especially at this altitude, so carrying George was slow; with many breaks.<br/><br/>After a while, the <em>Arrieros</em>, realizing that we were all struggling decided to step in. These guys are incredibly tough and are used to operating at this altitude. They literally picked George up in the stretcher and ran with him, on an uneven trail, in the pitch dark of the night, with only bouncing, dim head lamps to illuminate the trail.<br/><br/>At around midnight, we arrived at the road in Selma, where the truck was waiting for us - with two guides. Dr. Halvorson, George, Sacha, and myself loaded into the back seat, while the two guides road in the front as the driver and navigator. Our driver, knowing the area well, expertly navigated the dirt roads through the mountains and we made it to the hospital in Cusco in record time, just after 4:30. The hospital luckily had a decompression chamber and DAN (Divers Alert Network) walked the chamber operator through treating a diver with DCS. DAN certified the chamber on the spot. Sacha and I went back to the hotel for some much needed sleep.<br/><br/>When you've been through a traumatic experience, you're mind tends to not rest. When you're mind isn't resting, you sleep very little. This was one of those times. Neither Sacha nor I slept for very long.<br/><br/>The remaining expeditions members arrived form the field later that evening and immediately went to work on what to do. For the next several days, at least as long as I was in Cusco, people were working with Peruvian authorities, going back out to the field to look for any signs of Geoff, and attempting to comfort family members. During this time, I was still in shock and denial. I mostly spent my time either walking to to hospital to visit George or sitting by myself reliving the experiences in my head.
