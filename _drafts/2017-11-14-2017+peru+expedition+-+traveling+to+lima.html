Ever since my first expedition to Peru, I'd been wanting to get back. Traveling to Peru from the US is pretty painless, but it does involve a long day of travel.<br/><br/>In many cases, it involves leaving early-sh in the morning and arriving to Lima around midnight. There was no exception for this trip. For me, the biggest headache of the trip was arriving to the air port two hours before the departure to find the check-in counter completely empty.<br/><br/><img class="size-medium wp-image-150 aligncenter" src="https://jtdub.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/IMG_0981-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br/><br/>After contacting JetBlue, apparently the counter folks don't show up for work until 0830 - 0900. No big deal. It just meant that I had to wait around for a bit.<br/><br/><img class="size-medium wp-image-152 aligncenter" src="https://jtdub.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/IMG_0998-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br/><br/>My connecting flight was in Fort Lauderdale, FL. There I met up with my friend, Justin, and we caught our flight to Lima. The flight between to Lima is fairly long; about six hours. I managed to sleep most of the way.<br/><br/>Once in Lima, we met up with the remainder of the expedition team and friends, where we caught a ride to the hotel for the night.
