<p>From time to time, I post blogs on external sites. This is mostly for work, but this is a collection of external blog posts that I've contributed to.</p>

<div class="container mt-5">
  <div class="row">
{% for post in site.data.external_posts %}
  {% include external_posts.html %}
{% endfor %}
  </div>
