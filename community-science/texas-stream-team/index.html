                    <h3>Program Overview</h3>
                    <p>The Texas Stream Team represents a statewide citizen science initiative focused on water quality monitoring and environmental education. As a community scientist and data coordinator, this work demonstrates the power of collaborative research approaches.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Research Methods</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Water Quality Testing:</strong> Regular monitoring of chemical, physical, and biological parameters</li>
                        <li><strong>Citizen Science Training:</strong> Educational workshops and field training for community volunteers</li>
                        <li><strong>Data Validation:</strong> Quality control and verification of community-collected datasets</li>
                        <li><strong>Community Engagement:</strong> Public outreach and environmental education programs</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h4>Impact and Outcomes</h4>
                    <p>The program has generated extensive long-term monitoring datasets while building local environmental awareness and scientific capacity. Community volunteers contribute thousands of hours of data collection annually.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Research Applications</h4>
                    <p>Data collected through the Stream Team program supports academic research, environmental management decisions, and community-led conservation efforts throughout Texas.</p>
