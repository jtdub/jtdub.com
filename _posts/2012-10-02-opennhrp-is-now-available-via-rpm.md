After a LONG hiatus, I'm finally starting to work on my Open Source implementation of DMVPN, again. So far, I've started off by taking the [OpenNHRP](http://sourceforge.net/projects/opennhrp/) source code and building RPM files. I made no changes to the source code itself. Heck, I don't even consider myself a developer. I just built the RPM binaries so that a person could build a DMVPN device without needing to have developer tools installed on the device itself. It should be a little more secure that way. :)

Currently, the RPM files are being built in a CentOS 6 x86_64 environment. However, if this is something that people like, I will entertain building the RPM's for 32 bit environment or possibly deb packages for ubuntu / debian based environments.

The binary and source RPM's are available right now! I'm still testing them to make sure everything is working properly.Â  You can get the package by installing the repository:

```bash
[root@server ~]# curl http://tools.packetgeek.net/pgn.repo -o /etc/yum.repos.d/pgn.repo
[root@server ~]# yum search opennhrp

opennhrp.x86_64 : OpenNHRP implements NBMA Next Hop Resolution Protocol (as defined in RFC 2332). It makes it possible to create dynamic
                : multipoint VPN Linux router using NHRP, GRE and IPsec. It aims to be Cisco DMVPN compatible.

  Name and summary matches only, use "search all" for everything.

Have fun! I look forward to getting an open source of a DMVPN implementation up and running soon! Leave a comment if you have any comments or questions.
