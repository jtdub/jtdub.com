I know and use Perl and Bash fairly regularly with automating system administration tasks. Lately, I've been putting some effort into learning python, as I believe that it will help me grow in my career. I've been using <a href="http://learnpythonthehardway.org/" target="_blank">Learn Python the Hard Way</a>. So far, it's been a pretty awesome site! I need to think of some projects to continue to increase my capabilities with it. Maybe, I'll post some code examples as I create some projects. Either way, check out the site. It's pretty awesome!
