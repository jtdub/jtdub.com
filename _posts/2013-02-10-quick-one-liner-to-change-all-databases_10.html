I've been attempting to get a better understanding of the operations of MySQL. For me, the best way to do that is hands on. I had a database, with a lot of tables, that I wanted to change the engine type to InnoDB. Obviously, being a lazy sys admin, I didn't want to change them all by hand. So, I made a quick one-liner to do the job for me.

<br/>
<pre class="lang:default decode:true">for i in `mysql somedb -e 'show tables\G' | grep -v ^* | awk '{print $2}'`; do </pre>
<pre class="lang:default decode:true">    mysql somedb -e "ALTER TABLE $i ENGINE=INNODB"; </pre>
<pre class="lang:default decode:true">done</pre>
<br/>
