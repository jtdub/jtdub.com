Here are some notes from a recent RHCSA class.

#### Boot process

* RHEL 6 uses upstart instead of init. Upstart is setup to call the init scripts. [Upstart](http://upstart.ubuntu.com/)

#### Networking

* disable NetworkManager and edit /etc/sysconfig/network and /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-* by hand.
  * for i in NetworkManager; do service $i stop; chkconfig $i off; done

#### Cron

* Time  statements are ORâ€™ed together, NOT ANDâ€™ed together. So Sunday, January 2  would be January 2 OR Sunday. To get around that, youâ€™ll need to script  out the day of the week.

#### Disk Encryption

* LUKS - Linux Unified Key Setup
  * Create a new LUKS encrypted device:
    * cryptsetup luksFormat
  * Establish access to the device:
    * cryptsetup luksOpen
      * /dev/mapper/
  * Create the filesystem:
    * mkfs -t ext4 /dev/mapper/
  * Mount the filesystem:
    * mount /dev/mapper/
  * Make filesystem persistant:
    * vim /etc/fstab
      * /dev/mapper/cryptomount ext4 defaults 1 2
  * Removing access to an encrypted device:
    * Umount the filesystem, if mounted:
      * umount /mnt
    * cryptsetup luksClose mapname
  * To make LUKS devices available at boot time (persistance):
    * /etc/crypttab
      * [keyfile] [options]
  * To create a keyfile:
    * dd if=/dev/urandom of=/etc/keyfile bs=1k count=4
    * cryptsetup luksAddKey
    * chmod 400 /etc/keyfile
  * To test LUKS functionality for persistance:
    * umount /cryptfs
    * cryptsetup luksClose mapname
    * #> bash
    * #> . /etc/init.d/functions
    * #> init_crypto 1
    * #> mount -a
    * #> ls /cryptfs

#### SELinux

* Every process or object has a SELinux context:
  * identity:role:domain/type
* The SELinux policy controls:
  * What identities can use which roles
  * What roles can enter which domains
  * What domains can access which types
* To change the context of a file, you can use the chcon command:
  * chcon -R --reference=/var/www/html
* To restore the default labeling from the policy and apply the contexts to file:
  * restorecon -R
* To change the SELinux mode during boot, you can pass the â€˜enforcing=0â€™ option to the kernel in GRUB.
* Tools:
  * sestatus
  * setenforce | getenforce
  * policycoreutils
  * setroubleshoot
  * system-config-selinux &lt;- part of policycoreutils-gui in RHEL.
  * setsebool | getsebool
  * chcon
  * restorecon

#### Kernel Tuning

* Kernel documentation package: kernel-doc
  * yum -y install kernel-doc
  * /usr/share/doc/kernel-doc-2.6.32/Documentation/sysctl
* sysctl -a
  * displays all current values
* sysctl -w
  * sets a value
* sysctl -p
  * reads the /etc/sysctl.conf and loads the values into the kernel
* /etc/sysctl.conf
  * File location to make changes persistent
  * sysctl -w >> /etc/sysctl.conf

#### LVM

* Create a Volume
  * pvcreate /dev/sda4
  * vgcreate VolGroup01 /dev/sda4
    * -s flag will allow you to change the physical extent size. Default is 4MB and can be changed in increments of power of 2.
  * lvcreate -n Volname01 [ -L 10G || -l +100%FREE || -l +50 {# of extents} ] VolGroup01
* Resizing a volume
  * vgextend
  * lvextend { -l <+extents> | -L <+size> }
  * resize2fs
    * lvresize -r {-l <+extents> | -L <+size> }
      * â€˜-râ€™ - Resize logical volume and filesystem at the sametime.
  * lvreduce -r { -l | -L }
* Snapshots
  * create snapshots
    * lvcreate -s { -l | -L } -n
  * remove snapshots
    * lvremove -f
  *  You  will need space available in the volume group of your logical volume to  be able to create a snapshot. A snapshot logical volume does not need  to be the same size of the logical volume, but will need to be large  enough to contain the data of the logical volume.
  * You can grow the file system while it is mounted, but before shrinking it must first be unmounted.

#### NFS

* showmount -e server1
  * Confirm that services are running on the machine.
* rpcinfo -p server1
  * See shared filesystems.

####  Apache

* Documentation Package:
  * httpd-manual
* Documentation Location:
  * http://localhost/manual

####  Autofs

* Mounting NFS Home directories:
  * vi /etc/auto.master
    * /home/nfsÂ Â Â  /etc/auto.nfs
  * vi /etc/auto.nfs
    * * server:/home/nfs/&
