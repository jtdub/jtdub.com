It's been a while since I've updated this. I've since earned a CCNP and have several notes and such that I need to put up here from my studies. I'm also focusing on my professional development and continuing to learn more about advanced technologies in depth.
<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully soon, I'll be able to get my CCNP notes together and placed on the site, as well as notes on my future studies (CCNA Voice, CCNA Security, ASA Specialist, CEH, RHCE, and CCIE R&amp;S). I'm hoping to complete the CCNA Voice, Security, and ASA Specialist this year as well as get back to my project of putting together an open source DMVPN solution - more on that later.
