<div>Net Nuetrality is a very  important subject for anybody who connects to the Internet to watch TV,  movies, view websites, play games, work, and download files. Teir 1  telecommunications companies (AT&T, Verizon, Comcast, etc) want to  assign priorities to certain traffic instead of allowing ALL traffic  through their networks equally. Ser<span>...</span><span>vices like file downloads and streaming media  rich content (VoIP, streaming movie servcies like Netflix, etc) can be  degredated to a point where it's not worth it or impossible if the  telecommunications companies get their way. I don't know about you, but I  don't want my service provider to tell me how I can access the Internet  and at what speeds. The FCC has tried to enforce Net Nuetrality, but  the U.S. courts sided with Comcast. Our government needs to give the FCC  the necessary powers to enforce Net Nuetrality. It's good for the  consumer and will force the telecommunications companies to engineer  their networks to better support those services that people want.  Normally I'm a huge fan of de-regulation, but this is an instance where  an industry has proven that they can't be trusted to be unregulated.</span></div><div><span> </span></div><div><span><a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2010/05/11/netneutrality-grover-afp/">http://thinkprogress.org/2010/05/11/netneutrality-grover-afp/</a> </span></div>
