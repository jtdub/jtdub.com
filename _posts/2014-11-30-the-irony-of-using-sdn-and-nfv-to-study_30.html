I was recently asked to present at a local Network Engineering Meetup. The topic that I'm going to speak about is how I'm using KVM, OpenFlow, Network Overlays, and OVS to integrate my physical network lab and virtual network lab. The presentation can be found <a title="Physical and Virtual Network Lab Integration" href="http://f7038d968011578bff10-fe2c6ed9702abafda5370834b677ff92.r10.cf1.rackcdn.com/Physical-and-Virtual-Network-Lab-Integration.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.
