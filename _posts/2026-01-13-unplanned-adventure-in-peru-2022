In 2022, I embarked on a solo trip to the Peruvian Andes. I had been there a few times before, participating in scientific expeditions,
but this was my first solo trip there. For me, the trip was to immerse myself in the landscapes that I have come to love. The purpose of
the trip was to hike from my friends house below Apu Ausuangate to Ausaungatue, over The Condor Pass to Sibinacocha, navigate the
glacial morain on the north end of the lake to the east side of the lake, east of Apu Yayamari, and south into the small town of Phinaya.
