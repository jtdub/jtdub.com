I've recently have been experiencing issues with my IPv6 Tunnel with Tunnelbroker.net. While doing some searching on the Internet, I ran across this
<a href="http://forums.att.com/t5/2013/Re-UVerse-and-IPv6-Tunneling-with-3800-HGV-B/m-p/3797755#M40077" target="_blank">
 forum thread
</a>
on AT&amp;T, with users experiencing the same issue.
<br/>
<br/>
It appears that AT&amp;T is blocking SIT and GRE tunnels purposely - which have very legitimate purposes. After reading the forum thread, I filed a complaint with the FCC about AT&amp;T violating network neutrality rules. I then posted my actions on the thread and listed the FCC complaint reference number - 13-C00539997.
<br/>
<br/>
Shortly after, AT&amp;T removed the reference number from my post. I then edited the post and added it back. The AT&amp;T moderator then removed it again and sent me a private message stating that I wasn't allowed to post personal information. I replied back to her message and stated that it wasn't personal information and that it was a FCC complaint reference number. After sending the message, I again edited the post and added the reference number back. And told the moderator, by name, to not remove the reference number.
<br/>
<br/>
Now, I'm banned from the thread, and I got a nice nasty gram from the AT&amp;T moderator
<br/>

<br/>
With customer service like this, my FCC complaint will be for nought, as I'm just going to boycott AT&amp;T products all together. So long, AT&amp;T, you'll hardly be missed.
<br/>
<br/>
Update:
<br/>
<br/>
I received another private message, this time from another forum moderator.
<br/>
<br/>

Here is my response:
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<pre class="lang:default decode:true">I only violated the guideline of talking about why I was being moderated. Period. I did not violate the term of posting personal information, which initiated my rant. I do not agree with the terms of the guidelines and I do not agree with the horrible customer service actions that were taken against me. In the end, all is for naught. AT&amp;T has lost me as a loyal customer of the past 15 years. No longer will I use AT&amp;T. I'll be calling on Monday to cancel my service. Nor will I recommend it to friends, family, and colleagues. The forum moderation is horrendous and I will not soon forget this.<br/> <br/>Regards,<br/> <br/>James</pre>
