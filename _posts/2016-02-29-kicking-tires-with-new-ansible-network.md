Ansible [recently announced](http://www.redhat.com/en/about/press-releases/red-hat-brings-devops-network-new-ansible-capabilities) support for multi-vendor network modules, natively within Ansible. There are many examples on the Internet where individuals have taken the initiative to create their own modules to work with their favorite vendor. Some of these examples are Arista [supplied modules](https://github.com/arista-eosplus/ansible-eos), [NX-OS modules](https://github.com/jedelman8/nxos-ansible) created by Jason Edelman, [NTC](https://github.com/networktocode/ntc-ansible), and [NAPALM](https://github.com/napalm-automation/napalm-ansible). While these are all good, it's nice to see that Ansible is taking some initiative to create some native functionality.

These modules aren't yet in the stable release of Ansible, but they do make an appearance in the development version, so I decided to kick the tires a bit.

First thing I did was set up an development environment using python's virtualenv.

```bash
mkdir -p ansible2.0/env
cd ansible2.0
virtualenv env
source env/bin/activate
git clone git@github.com:ansible/ansible.git
cd ansible
git submodule init
git submodule update
python setup.py install
```

Next, I verified the version of Ansible that I'm running in my development environment, as well as verifying that I have the new modules available to me.

```bash
(env)jtdub-macbook:ansible jtdub$ ansible --version
ansible 2.1.0
  config file = 
  configured module search path = Default w/o overrides
(env)jtdub-macbook:ansible jtdub$ ansible-doc --list | egrep ^'ios|eos|junos|nxos'

eos_config                      Manage Arista EOS configuration sections

junos_template                  Manage Juniper JUNOS device configurations                                                             
nxos_command                    Run arbitrary command on Cisco NXOS devices                                                            
nxos_config                     Manage Cisco NXOS configuration sections                                                               
nxos_nxapi                      Manage NXAPI configuration on an NXOS device.                                                          
nxos_template                   Manage Cisco NXOS device configurations
```

At the time of this writing. It looks like the [online documentation](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/list_of_network_modules.html) has been updated, which would infer that the new modules may soon be in the stable release.

So, let's create a sample playbook!

The first thing I did was create an inventory file. I kept it simple and created a file called 'hosts'

```
[ios]
edge1
aggr1a
```

Then I created a secrets.yaml file to store my credentials without having to put them in a playbook. While I won't share my credentials here, I will share the format that I used. :)

```yaml
---
creds:
  username: cisco
  password: cisco
  auth_pass: cisco
```

Lastly, I created a sample playbook. I wanted a task that Â utilized each module type - (ios|eos|junos|nxos)_(command|template|config). Currently, I have easy access to a couple of IOS devices, so I stuck with using those modules, but I played with each ios_(command|config) module. I plan on spending time and playing with the ios_template module more at a later time.

Here is my sample playbook:

```yaml
---
- hosts: ios
  gather_facts: no
  connection: local

  tasks:
  - name: OBTAIN LOGIN CREDENTIALS
    include_vars: secrets.yaml

  - name: DEFINE PROVIDER
    set_fact:
      provider:
        host: "{{ inventory_hostname }}"
        username: "{{ creds['username'] }}"
        password: "{{ creds['password'] }}"
        auth_pass: "{{ creds['auth_pass'] }}"

  - name: RUN 'SHOW VERSION'
    ios_command:
      provider: "{{ provider }}"
      commands:
        - show version
    register: version

  - debug: var=version.stdout_lines

  - name: RUN 'SHOW ACCESS-LIST TEST'
    ios_command:
      provider: "{{ provider }}"
      commands:
        - show access-list TEST 
    register: before_acl

  - debug: var=before_acl.stdout_lines

  - name: CREATE 'TEST' ACCESS-LIST
    ios_config:
      provider: "{{ provider }}"
      authorize: yes
      lines:
        - 10 permit ip host 1.1.1.1 any
        - 20 deny ip any any
      parents: ['ip access-list extended TEST']
      before: ['no ip access-list extended TEST']
      match: exact

  - name: RUN 'SHOW ACCESS-LIST TEST'
    ios_command:
      provider: "{{ provider }}"
      commands:
        - show access-list TEST 
    register: after_acl

  - debug: var=after_acl.stdout_lines
```

In this playbook, I first import my secrets.yaml variables, which includes my credentials to log into the devices. I then define the 'provider' variable. The provider variable allows you to create a host, username, password, and auth_pass key value in a single place and call it as a single variable, rather than defining each individually for each task. It's a nice little time saver! Finally, I started doing work on the devices themselves.

As you can see, I was able to successfully execute a 'show version', verify that I had no access-list called TEST, create it, then verify that it was indeed created.

I'm thrilled that Ansible is finally getting around to recognizing the benefit of supporting the networking community. It's a basic start and it will only get better from here! Soon, I'll post a blog walking through the ios_template module. The documentation on that one looks interesting!
