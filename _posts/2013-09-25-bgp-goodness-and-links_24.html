I had my first real experience with playing with regular expressions in BGP this evening to manipulate traffic. In the instance below, I needed to give a lower preference to traffic that was learned from '65002' and was 4 AS hops out. I did this by creating an as-path access-list, using it in a route-map, and applying it to an eBGP neighbor.<br/><br/> <br/><pre class="lang:default decode:true " >ip as-path access-list 61 permit ^65002_[0-9]+_[0-9]+_[0-9]+$<br/>route-map SomeBGPTransit-in permit 15<br/> match as-path 61<br/> set local-preference 90<br/>end<br/>wr mem</pre> <br/><br/>While I'm at it, I figured that I share the two links that have helped me the most with BGP. The first is the <a href="http://media.packetlife.net/media/library/1/BGP.pdf" title="BGP Cheat Sheet" target="_blank">BGP cheat sheet</a> from <a href="http://packetlife.net" title="packetlife.net" target="_blank">PacketLife.net</a>. The second is an <a href="http://www.ine.com/" target="_blank">INE</a> blog post on <a href="http://blog.ine.com/2008/01/06/understanding-bgp-regular-expressions/" target="_blank">BGP Regular Expressions</a>.
