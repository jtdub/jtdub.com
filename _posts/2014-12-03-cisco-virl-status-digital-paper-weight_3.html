I fixed the issue. Turns out, I'm a dim wit. There is an updated post, with tips and lessons learned,

.
<br/>
<br/>
I was excited that VIRL was finally released. On impulse, I went ahead and bought it, even though I thought it was a little pricey. So far, I haven't had any luck with it. It appears that I'm not the only one.
<br/>
<br/>
For my install, I chose bare-metal, as I had the computer to spare. The install is a little clunky, but I worked my way through it. Udev changed the designated eth0 device to p3p1, which I'm used to and made the necessary changes in /etc/network/interfaces. After the install, you're supposed to configure NTP and activate the VIRL instance with Cisco's salt infrastructure. This is where the rub comes in. No matter what I do or try, I can't get it to register.
<br/>
<br/>
I've configured NTP - and verified that I had a proper NTP association per these two support threads:

</a>
<br/>
<br/>
I've verified that my VIRL instance can ping the Cisco salt infrastructure. I can also telnet to their service ports. From my view. It should be working, but no matter what I do, I get this screen:
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
 <a href="/images/Screen-Shot-2014-12-03-at-3.57.52-AM.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;">
  <img border="0" data-original-height="594" data-original-width="906" height="209" src="/images/Screen-Shot-2014-12-03-at-3.57.52-AM.png" width="320"/>
 </a>
</div>
<br/>
<br/>
I'm also a little irritated with the VIRL support forums, as I can't post this screen shot, because I'm a 'new users'. The best that I can do is link to it.
