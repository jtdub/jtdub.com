<i><b>Update:&nbsp;</b></i> I fixed the issue. Turns out, I'm a dim wit. There is an updated post, with tips and lessons learned, <a href="http://www.packetgeek.net/2014/12/cisco-virl-bare-metal-install-tips-and-lessons-learned/">here</a>.<br /><br />I was excited that VIRL was finally released. On impulse, I went ahead and bought it, even though I thought it was a little pricey. So far, I haven't had any luck with it. It appears that I'm not the only one.<br /><br />For my install, I chose bare-metal, as I had the computer to spare. The install is a little clunky, but I worked my way through it. Udev changed the designated eth0 device to p3p1, which I'm used to and made the necessary changes in /etc/network/interfaces. After the install, you're supposed to configure NTP and activate the VIRL instance with Cisco's salt infrastructure. This is where the rub comes in. No matter what I do or try, I can't get it to register.<br /><br />I've configured NTP - and verified that I had a proper NTP association per these two support threads:<br /><br /><a href="http://community.dev-innovate.com/t/activation-error/743" target="_blank">Activation Error</a><br /><br /><a href="http://community.dev-innovate.com/t/virl-time-and-ntp-requirements/783" target="_blank">VIRL Time and NTP Requirements</a><br /><br />I've verified that my VIRL instance can ping the Cisco salt infrastructure. I can also telnet to their service ports. From my view. It should be working, but no matter what I do, I get this screen:<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ir_hHARbfuc/XK-MzH_hgvI/AAAAAAAA2HA/t9FIgvon1kcv2cAS7Sp3BSTF5uwT6UvwQCLcBGAs/s1600/Screen-Shot-2014-12-03-at-3.57.52-AM.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="594" data-original-width="906" height="209" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ir_hHARbfuc/XK-MzH_hgvI/AAAAAAAA2HA/t9FIgvon1kcv2cAS7Sp3BSTF5uwT6UvwQCLcBGAs/s320/Screen-Shot-2014-12-03-at-3.57.52-AM.png" width="320" /></a></div><br /><br />I'm also a little irritated with the VIRL support forums, as I can't post this screen shot, because I'm a 'new users'. The best that I can do is link to it.<br /><br />If you know what I may be doing wrong - or if you know of a fix, shoot me a DM on <a href="http://twitter.com/packetgeeknet" target="_blank">twitter</a>.
