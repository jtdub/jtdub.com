As a network engineer, a fundamental task is putting a base configuration onto a device via a serial console. In Windows, there are several applications from Hyper Terminal to Putty. In Linux, there is minicom. I've never been a Microsoft fan, but have been a Linux user for many years. Over the last few years have been using Mac OS X full time for work and personal. Given this, I need the ability to access a network device via a serial connection. A quick Google was

.
<br/>
<ol>
 <br/>
 <li>
  Plug your USB to Serial device into the USB port.
 </li>
 <br/>
 <li>
  Open a command termal and execute:
  <strong>
   ls /dev/*usb*
  </strong>
 </li>
 <br/>
</ol>
<br/>
If your Mac recognizes the USB device, it will display a USB device in
<strong>
 /dev
</strong>
. If not, you may need to download and install a USB driver for your device. I used

 this article

to assist me in determining which USB driver to download and install.
<br/>
<ol>
 <br/>
 <li>
  My USB device showed up as
  <strong>
   /dev/tty.usbserial
  </strong>
  , thus I'll use that for the remainder of this example.
 </li>
 <br/>
 <li>
  Connect the other end of yourÂ USB to Serial cable into your network device's serial port.
 </li>
 <br/>
 <li>
  Execute:
  <strong>
   screen /dev/tty.usbserial 9600
  </strong>
  <br/>
  <ol>
   <br/>

    is a UNIX utility that allows you to access your local computers VT100 terminal.
   </li>
   <br/>
   <li>
    <strong>
     /dev/tty.usbserial
    </strong>
    is the driver to access your USB serial device.
   </li>
   <br/>
   <li>
    <strong>
     9600
    </strong>
    is the baud rate.
   </li>
   <br/>
  </ol>
  <br/>
 </li>
 <br/>
 <li>
  Press enter and you should be prompted with your network device prompt.
 </li>
 <br/>
 <li>
  To disconnect use the following key sequence:
  <strong>
   CTRL+A
  </strong>
  followed by
  <strong>
   CTRL+\
  </strong>
 </li>
