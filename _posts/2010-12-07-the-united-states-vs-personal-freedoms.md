I generally do not get overly involved in politics, because I've resigned myself to the fact that it's a completely flawed system and I'm going to find something that I don't agree with anyways. But I've been noticing a very disturbing trend as of late.

It mostly pertains to the fact that the US Government can not seem to protect confidential data, which is evident by the mass amount of data being tossed around the Internet by WikiLeaks. I am actually in favor of WikiLeaks. I'm thoroughly convinced that the US Government, among other world governments are upset with WikiLeaks because they are airing out their dirty laundry. Why would the US Government be that upset unless they are afraid of unethical and perhaps illegal dealings being exposed? Apparently, the US Government is all for whistle blowing, unless somebody is blowing the whistle on the US Government. Here's a tip for the US Government. If you're afraid of what people will think WHEN the information get's made public, then don't do it. The digital age is making it harder and harder for anybody to keep secrets. I personally think that it's a good thing and will keep people honest; Unless the US Government wants to pull a China and start censoring everything that US citizens can view on the Internet.

The US Government has also seen itself fit to start hi-jacking domain names on the Internet for offenders that it see's as breaking some sort of law, such as copy right.

What does the US involvement of actively attacking whistle blowing against the US, domain hi-jacking, and even full body scanners at US airports have in common? It's all about how the US Government is stealing the freedoms and liberties of US citizens little by little, so that no body notices until it's too late. I'm very disturbed by this trend. I'll be posting articles and information from time to time about this subject from now on, because I feel that it's important enough to track closely as well probably start becoming more active in protecting my freedoms and liberties that the government see's fit to take away.

[Lieberman Introduces Anti-WikiLeaks Legislation](http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/12/shield/)

Essentially this proposed legislation will make it illegal to "name names". It's a directly conflict with whistle blowing laws and a violation of my freedom of speech. Here's a big FUCK YOU Mr. Lieberman. You were one of the politicians that I had some sort of respect for. So much for that.

[The Wikileaks sex files: How two one-night stands sparked a worldwide hunt for Julian Assange](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1336291/Wikileaks-Julian-Assanges-2-night-stands-spark-worldwide-hunt.html?ito=feeds-newsxml)

Very good article, but long article short - Assange is a celebrity and a playboy of sorts. He had consensual unprotected sex with two women within days of each other, in Sweden. The women found out about each other and went to the police. Apparently, in Sweden, it can be construed as rape if you have unprotected sex with a person. Who knew? Would this international man hunt have occurred if Assange hadn't been airing out the dirty laundry of international government authorities? My guess is most likely not.
