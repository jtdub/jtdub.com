I plan on studying for the CCNP Service Provider - SPROUTE exam over the up coming months. I suppose the best place to start is from the beginning and work my way through the requirements. As I study, I'll keep notes and publish them here. Up first, "OSPFv2 and OSPFv3 Routing in Service Provider Environments".

As I have make my notes, I'll create blogs about them.
