In conjunction with my knowledge of how IPv4 subnetting works, <a href="http://etherealmind.com/" target="_blank">Ethereal Minds</a>' blog on "<a href="http://etherealmind.com/ipv6-address-allocation-numbers/" target="_blank">/48 allocation in /64 chunks</a>" got my mind going on IPv6 subnetting and how it works. I'll write more on it soon, but it's pretty easy to understand if you understand how to subnet IPv4 networks. Same concepts, but with 16 bit fields and 128 bit long addresses.
