## Introduction

This literature review supports my Anthropology capstone project, which examines the research question: "How are the people of the Cordillera Vilcanota adapting to a changing climate?" The review is divided into two complementary parts: 1) peer-reviewed scientific evidence documenting climate change in the region, and 2) ethnographic studies describing local adaptation strategies. All sources focus specifically on the Cordillera Vilcanota region of Peru, a unique environment notable as one of the few places on Earth where glaciers exist within tropical latitudes.
