Today, some friends and I set off on an expedition to the Peruvian Andes, where we'll be exploring a remote mountain lake - above water and below water. During the trip, it's my goal to keep a video log each day describing what has been happening during the trip. To wet the appetite, here is a quick video of packing for the trip.
