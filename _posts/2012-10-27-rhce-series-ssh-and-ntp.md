#### SSH
* Configure key-based authentication.
* Configure additional options described in documentation.

#### NTP
* Synchronize time using other NTP peers.

In Red Hat 6 (and I'm sure in 5 as well), public key authentication is enabled by default, but if you're unsure, you can uncomment the option and verify that it is set to yes.

```bash
[root@server1 ~]# vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config 
[root@server1 ~]# egrep 'PubkeyAuthentication|AuthorizedKeysFile' /etc/ssh/sshd_config 
PubkeyAuthentication yes
AuthorizedKeysFile .ssh/authorized_keys
[root@server1 ~]# service sshd restart
Stopping sshd:                                             [  OK  ]
Starting sshd:                                             [  OK  ]
```

Once that is complete. We can go to our client pc, generate keys, and copy the public key over.

```bash
[root@client1 ~]# ssh-keygen -t rsa
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/root/.ssh/id_rsa): 
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): 
Enter same passphrase again: 
Your identification has been saved in /root/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
c6:83:f5:86:ad:cf:06:d3:73:f6:22:8f:0a:a7:06:99 root@client1.example.com
The key's randomart image is:
+--[ RSA 2048]----+

[root@client1 ~]# ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub 192.168.1.1
The authenticity of host '192.168.1.1 (192.168.1.1)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is 40:f4:04:4b:68:53:92:55:82:f2:f4:68:db:0a:14:4f.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
Warning: Permanently added '192.168.1.1' (RSA) to the list of known hosts.
root@192.168.1.1's password: 
Now try logging into the machine, with "ssh '192.168.1.1'", and check in:

  .ssh/authorized_keys

to make sure we haven't added extra keys that you weren't expecting.
```

Once that has completed, we can ssh to 192.168.1.1 (server1) from client1 without a password, but use a private / public key exchange.

Now, let's configure ntp.

```bash
[root@client1 ~]# date
Sun Oct 28 04:32:13 CDT 2012
[root@client1 ~]# yum -y install ntp
[root@client1 ~]# grep server /etc/ntp.conf 
# Use public servers from the pool.ntp.org project.

[root@client1 ~]# service ntpd start

```

If you want to use other peers, you can modify the 'server' directive in /etc/ntpd.conf. Besure to use 'chkconfig' to make ntpd persistent.
