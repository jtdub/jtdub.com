In 2022, I embarked on a solo trip to the Peruvian Andes. I had traveled there several times before as part of scientific expeditions, but this was my first journey alone. This trip was not about research or documentation. It was about immersion. I wanted to move through the landscapes I had come to love and experience them on my own terms.

My plan was ambitious. I intended to hike from my friends’ home, the Crispins’, located below Apu Ausangate, cross Condor Pass, continue on to Sibinacocha, navigate the glacial moraine along the lake’s northern edge to its eastern side near Apu Yayamari, and then travel south to the small town of Phinaya.

Early on the first morning, Felipe and his brother, Gumercindo, met me in Cusco. From there, we took a taxi to their community of Pukarumi. The Crispins’ home is simple: adobe structures set against a dramatic backdrop of Ausangate towering above their land. Horses grazed nearby, along with guinea pigs, chickens, and alpacas. A small greenhouse stood beside the house, allowing them to grow crops that would not otherwise survive at this elevation. These crops help fortify their diet.

Felipe’s wife, Juliana, dressed in traditional Quechua attire, moved steadily through her morning chores. Gumercindo set out a bowl of chuño, freeze-dried potatoes that are a staple of Andean diets. It is, in many ways, an Andean power bar. They offered me some, and I accepted. When I travel, I often eat things I would not normally eat at home. Part of that is a desire to experience the culture as it exists, and part of it is respect. The chuño itself was not my favorite. It was calories without flavor, and my Americanized taste buds are conditioned to spices and seasoning.

Felipe and Gumercindo gathered the necessary supplies, loaded them onto horses, and we began walking. The elevation near the base of Ausangate is approximately 15,000 feet (4,600 meters). While the terrain itself is not technical, the altitude makes even simple movement physically demanding.

They moved briskly across the landscape, leading the horses with ease. They are accustomed to both the terrain and the elevation. Back home, I live at less than 700 feet (200 meters) above sea level, and my body always needs time to adjust. This is why I typically spend several days acclimating in Cusco, which sits at around 11,000 feet (3,600 meters). Even so, the jump from 11,000 to 15,000 feet is significant. Walking becomes slow and deliberate. Breathing is labored. My head throbs. From past expeditions, I know this is normal and temporary, and that expecting my body to perform as it does at sea level is unrealistic.

We stopped for lunch beside an aqueduct channeling glacial meltwater from Ausangate into the Vilcanota River. This watershed forms one of the primary headwaters of the Amazon River system. The water flowing through this high-altitude landscape sustains countless people, plants, and animals as it travels eastward, eventually reaching the Amazon Basin and, finally, the Atlantic Ocean.

After lunch, we continued toward the base of Ausangate, where we set up camp near the Seven Lakes of Ausangate. Shortly after arriving, the sun dropped behind the mountains and the temperature fell rapidly. I pitched my tent, bundled myself in warm clothes, and watched as the sky faded into darkness.

As is often the case at campsites in Peru, local dogs soon appeared, lingering in hopes of finding scraps. Gumercindo and Felipe prepared dinner, and we shared a hearty meal before turning in for the night. Sleep, however, did not come easily. I developed a headache and felt nauseous. I drank water and tried to rest, hoping the symptoms would pass, but instead they set the tone for the remainder of the journey.

The next day, we packed up camp and began our slow walk around Ausangate toward the next campsite. I still did not feel well. Between the nausea, lack of sleep, and altitude, my body felt weak and uncooperative. We moved at an unhurried pace, meandering through the landscape and stopping to visit the seven lakes. Eventually, the trail turned upward and we began our ascent toward Campa Pass at 16,500 feet (5,100 meters).

The walking was slow and labored. My head throbbed, my strength felt drained, and we stopped often. During those breaks, Felipe pointed out the surrounding peaks, naming them one by one: Callangate, Pachanta, Puku Punta, Mariposa. He also shared local folklore, including the story of the daughters of Ausangate.

The legend of Ausangate’s daughters is used to explain aspects of the local ecology of the Vilcanota. In the story, one of Ausangate’s daughters marries a man from the altiplano. The new son-in-law wishes to bring livestock and corn back to his homeland, but a bird steals the spirit of the corn and carries it to Cusco. There, the corn thrives, while it fails to grow in the altiplano. As punishment, the son-in-law is turned into a black rock near a road on the plateau. To this day, people curse the rock as they pass.

At the top of Campa Pass, we rested and ate lunch before descending the far side. From there, we wandered through bofedales, peat bogs saturated with glacial meltwater, until we found a flat, dry place to camp. After dinner, I turned in early, hoping a night of rest would restore some strength.

The next morning, I still felt weak. We had planned for a shorter day, knowing that the following day would require climbing over Condor Pass at more than 17,000 feet (5,200 meters) before descending toward Murmurani. The walking that day was relatively easy, with little elevation gain, and I decided to continue. We followed the valley carved by centuries of glacial retreat and reached our camp by midafternoon. Ausangate stood behind us, and Condor Pass loomed ahead. In my weakened state, it felt daunting. I spent the remainder of the afternoon resting, hoping to regain enough strength to continue.
By the next morning, I still did not feel well. I spoke with Felipe and Gumercindo and told them I did not feel strong enough to make the climb that day. We discussed our options and decided to walk to the nearest town, Chilca, where we would try to find a ride to Pitumarca.

Chilca is a small village in the Cordillera Vilcanota. It is the kind of town defined by a single road with a handful of buildings on either side. There is a small store, but most of the people who live there are pastoralists. They raise alpaca, llamas, and sheep, and grow potatoes and other crops adapted to the harsh, arid alpine climate.
