In 2022, I embarked on a solo trip to the Peruvian Andes. I had traveled there several times before as part of scientific expeditions, but this was my first journey alone. The purpose of this trip was not research or documentation, but immersion. I wanted to spend time moving through the landscapes I had come to love and experience them on my own terms.
My plan was ambitious. I intended to hike from my friends’ home, the Crispins, located below Apu Ausangate, cross the Condor Pass, continue on to Sibinacocha, navigate the glacial moraine along the lake’s northern edge to its eastern side near Apu Yayamari, and then travel south to the small town of Phinaya.

Early on the first morning, Felipe and his brother, Gumercindo, met me in Cusco. From there, we took a taxi to their community of Pukarumi. At their home, they gathered the necessary supplies and equipment, loaded everything onto horses, and we began walking. The elevation near the base of Ausangate is approximately 15,000 feet (4,600 meters). While the terrain itself is not technical, the altitude makes even simple movement physically demanding.

Felipe and Gumercindo moved briskly across the landscape, leading the horses with ease. They are accustomed to both the terrain and the elevation. Back home, I live at less than 700 feet (200 meters) above sea level, and my body always needs time to adjust to altitude. This is why I typically spend three days acclimating in Cusco, which sits at around 11,000 feet (3,600 meters). Even so, the jump from 11,000 to 15,000 feet is significant. Walking becomes slow and deliberate. Breathing is labored. My head throbs. From past expeditions, I know this is normal and temporary, and that expecting my body to perform as it does at sea level is unrealistic.

We stopped for lunch beside an aqueduct channeling glacial meltwater from Ausangate into the Vilcanota River. This watershed is one of the primary headwaters of the Amazon River system. The water flowing through this high-altitude landscape sustains thousands of people, plants, and animals as it travels eastward, eventually reaching the Amazon Basin and, finally, the Atlantic Ocean.

After lunch, we continued toward the base of Apu Ausangate, where we set up camp near the Seven Lakes of Ausangate. Shortly after arriving at camp, the sun dropped behind the mountains and the temperature fell rapidly. I pitched my tent, bundled myself in warm clothes, and watched as the sky faded into darkness.

As is often the case at campsites in Peru, local dogs soon appeared, lingering in hopes of finding scraps of food. Gumercindo and Felipe prepared dinner, and we shared a hearty meal before turning in for the night. Sleep, however, did not come easily. I developed a headache and felt nauseous. I drank water and tried to rest, hoping the symptoms would pass, but instead they set the tone for the remainder of the journey.

The next day, we packed up camp and began our slow walk around Ausangate toward the next campsite. I still wasn’t feeling great. Between the nausea from the night before, the lack of sleep, and the altitude, my body felt weak and uncooperative. We moved at an unhurried pace, meandering through the landscape and stopping to visit the seven lakes of Ausangate. Eventually, the trail turned upward and we began our ascent toward Campa Pass at 16,500 feet (5,100 meters).

The walking was slow and labored. My head throbbed and my strength felt drained, forcing us to stop often. During those breaks, Felipe would point out the surrounding peaks and name them one by one: Callangate, Pachanta, Puku Punta, Mariposa. He also shared local folklore, including the story of the daughters of Ausangate.

The legend of Ausangate’s daughters is used to explain aspects of the local ecology of the Vilcanota. In the story, one of Ausangate’s daughters marries a man from the altiplano. The new son-in-law wishes to take livestock and corn back to his homeland, but a bird steals the spirit of the corn and carries it to Cusco. There, the corn thrives, while it fails to grow in the altiplano. As punishment, the son-in-law is turned into a black rock near a road on the plateau. To this day, people still curse the rock as they pass.

At the top of Campa Pass, we rested and ate lunch before descending the far side. From there, we wandered through bofedales; peat bogs saturated with glacial meltwater; until we found a flat, dry place to camp. After dinner, I turned in early, hoping that a night of rest would help restore some strength.
